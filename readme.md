    <li><h3><a href='https://www.kaggle.com/code/ebrahimghantiwala/global-monkeypox-cases-analysis'>Global Monkeypox Cases analysis</a></h3></li>
      <p>Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research, hence the name ‘monkeypox.’ The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a period of intensified effort to eliminate smallpox.
Recently however, an outbreak of the viral disease monkeypox was confirmed in May 2022, beginning with a cluster of cases found in the United Kingdom. The first recognized case was confirmed on 6 May 2022 and reported cases thus far have no established travel links to an endemic area. From 18 May onwards, cases were reported from an increasing number of countries and regions, predominantly in Europe, but also in North and South America, Asia, North Africa, and Australia.</p>

  <li><h2>Touchless elevator buttons using IR Sensors.</h2></li>
  <p>During this pandemic situation we discovered that a lot of diseases are spread through touch and the most common area for people to touch in commercial and residential areas is a lift. We decided to come up with a solution to this problem during our IOT internship by using an IR sensor to select buttons by hovering instead of touching the buttons.</p>
  <li><h2>Online Counsellor</h2></li>
  <p>In this project we developed a website that allows students to search for all the necessary information pertaining to the universities they desire, the courses they wish to learn, the admission processes, teacher profiles, alumni information, career paths, employers have partnered with the universities, and more.
The website has user-friendly filters to search for universities and courses based on a student’s needs and requirements.
Future Scope of this project includes :
Students will be able to chat with representatives of universities directly from the website and will be able to submit applications and save bookmarks of their favorite universities and courses.</p>
  <li><h2><a href="https://car-booking-system.000webhostapp.com/index.php">Car rental system</a></h2></li>
  <p>The function of an online car rental and booking system is to take inputs related to the user such as their email ID and password for login information. 
This web app administers the users’ account on the go. The frontend is very convenient for customers so they can quickly make bookings with you and see your news and promotions. The app also comes with a payment receipt generation towards the end of the rental transaction process. Users can make their payments towards the starting of the renting period, taking into consideration the number of hours the rental car would be booked for. If a driver decides to rent a car beforehand, they go to a car rental website or app and find a vehicle that meets their needs. Then, they book it and pay for the chosen rental period, if upfront payment is required. On the appointed day, this customer arrives at the car rental location to pick up the chosen car. An agent makes copies of their IDs, explains the terms of the lease, instructs them on any special features of the car, and finally hands them the keys. When the customer drops off the car, the agent checks its mileage and inspects for any damages.</p>

  <p>StudyRooms are rooms where people around the world can join in and discuss about the topics and also solve each others doubts.</p>
